# WBC 2026: Win Probabilities, Full Roster Breakdown, and Why the Dominican Republic Is No Longer a "Pitching Question Mark"

## A data-driven preview of all 20 nations — from a baseball obsessive in Tokyo

The World Baseball Classic is back. March 5–17, 2026. Twenty nations. Four host cities. And I get to watch it with nine trained AI models and a full MLB player performance database at my fingertips.

Full disclosure: I'm Japanese. I grew up in Tokyo. I will be watching every Samurai Japan game with the same irrational passion I had as a kid staying up until 3 AM to watch the 2006 WBC. But this newsletter is about data, not nationalism. So let's be honest about every team's chances — including Japan's.

## Win Probabilities — All 20 Teams

This is the section I built the whole article around. Every WBC preview covers Japan and USA. I wanted to run the full set of numbers for all 20 countries — and give you the actual reasoning behind each figure.

**How these numbers work:** I started from the DraftKings opening lines (-115 to +40000), removed the bookmaker's margin, then adjusted based on roster strength, pool difficulty, and knockout bracket position. These aren't just converted odds — they're my model's best estimate of actual tournament win probability.

---

### 🇺🇸 USA — **39% win probability** (DK: -115)

The deepest roster in WBC history, and it's not particularly close.

**Why 39%:** Both reigning Cy Young Award winners — Tarik Skubal (2024, 2025) and Paul Skenes (2025) — are on the roster. That's a legitimate two-ace punch no team in tournament history has matched. Aaron Judge at captain, Bryce Harper, Bobby Witt Jr., Gunnar Henderson, and Cal Raleigh (60 HR in 2025) provide the lineup firepower. Mason Miller closes.

**The catch:** Skubal will only make one start due to load management. Mike Trout is out (insurance). And short-tournament variance is real — even -115 favorites lose single-elimination games more than half the time.

**What to watch:** Pool B is soft (Great Britain, Brazil, Italy, Mexico). USA should cruise to the knockout round, arriving rested and with pitching relatively fresh.

---

### 🇯🇵 Japan — **21% win probability** (DK: +330)

Defending champions. Sixteen players returning from the 2023 title run. But meaningfully weaker in pitching depth than three years ago.

**Why 21%:** Yoshinobu Yamamoto (2025 World Series MVP) is the ace, and he's as good as anyone in this tournament. Yusei Kikuchi and Tomoyuki Sugano round out the rotation. Shohei Ohtani (2025 NL MVP) hits second — but won't pitch. Munetaka Murakami (CWS) and Kazuma Okamoto (TOR) bring elite power. Masataka Yoshida (BOS) was the last roster addition.

**The catch:** Japan is without Roki Sasaki, Yu Darvish, and Shota Imanaga — three of the five rotation starters from 2023. The bullpen will be tested in Pool C, which includes South Korea, and the bracket likely routes them through both DR and Venezuela in the knockout rounds.

**What to watch:** Manager Hirokazu Ibata's bullpen management in tight games. The 2023 team's late-game execution was historically disciplined. Can he recreate that with a new corps of relievers?

---

### 🇩🇴 Dominican Republic — **16% win probability** (DK: +400)

The most significant roster upgrade in this WBC. The DR finally fixed their biggest weakness.

**Why 16%:** In 2023, the DR's rotation was a liability — Roansy Contreras, a late-career Johnny Cueto. This year: Cristopher Sánchez (2.50 ERA, 212 K in 202 IP in 2025), Sandy Alcantara, Brayan Bello, and Luis Severino. That's four legitimate MLB starters in their prime. The lineup was already elite — Juan Soto, Fernando Tatis Jr., Julio Rodriguez, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Oneil Cruz — and now the pitching can match it. Albert Pujols managing, fresh off winning the Caribbean Series with Leones del Escogido.

**The catch:** Pool D (Miami) with Venezuela means one of these two powerhouses exits in pool play. That's a massive structural disadvantage for both teams.

**What to watch:** The Pool D gauntlet. If the DR avoids a stumble against Venezuela or Netherlands (Bogaerts, Albies, Profar), they arrive in the quarterfinals battle-tested.

---

### 🇻🇪 Venezuela — **9% win probability** (DK: +900)

The team with the highest talent-to-odds gap in the tournament.

**Why 9%:** Ronald Acuña Jr., Jackson Chourio, Wilyer Abreu form an elite outfield. The catching corps — Salvador Pérez, William Contreras, Francisco Álvarez, Gabriel Moreno — is the deepest in the tournament. And the rotation is genuinely solid: Pablo López, Ranger Suárez, Eduardo Rodríguez.

**The catch:** Pool D against DR is effectively a quarterfinal. In 2023, Venezuela went 4-0 in group play and carried a lead into the 8th inning of their quarterfinal against the USA — until Trea Turner hit a grand slam. They're built to lose heartbreak games, not to avoid them.

**What to watch:** How manager Omar López deploys his bullpen in Pool D against DR. Conserving Pablo López for the knockout round could be the difference.

---

### 🇵🇷 Puerto Rico — **4% win probability** (DK: +1600)

The insurance crisis hit Puerto Rico hardest of any team.

**Why 4%:** Carlos Correa, Francisco Lindor, and José Berríos were all denied insurance coverage and withdrew. That's your starting shortstop, backup shortstop, and ace. The additions — Nolan Arenado (8x Gold Glove, 3B) and others — partially compensate, but the middle infield is thin. Pool A (San Juan) gives them home crowd energy, but Canada and Cuba are legitimate threats to their quarterfinal spot.

**What to watch:** Whether the home atmosphere in San Juan can compensate for the talent deficit. Puerto Rico has historically overperformed expectations at home.

---

### 🇲🇽 Mexico — **3% win probability** (DK: +2500)

The most underrated roster in the tournament based on pure pitching quality.

**Why 3%:** Andrés Muñoz (mid-to-high 90s, elite slider) closes games. The rotation includes Taj Bradley (named to the roster, though reports suggest he may prioritize MLB spring camp) and Javier Assad. Captain Alejandro Kirk, Jarren Duran, and Randy Arozarena (born in Cuba, plays for Mexico) anchor the lineup. Joey Ortiz at short, Alek Thomas in center. The problem: Pool B means they face Team USA and Italy for the two advancement spots.

**Why higher than you'd expect:** If Mexico advances — and they have the pitching to do it — their quarterfinal matchup could be favorable, since they'd likely face a Pool A team rather than Japan or the DR.

---

### 🇨🇦 Canada — **2% win probability** (DK: +4000)

Solid MLB representation, Pool A provides an easier path.

**Why 2%:** Jameson Taillon headlines the rotation. Edouard Julien, Michael Soroka, Denzel Clarke contribute. Canada has historically underperformed their talent level in WBC play, but Pool A (no powerhouses) gives them a realistic shot at a quarterfinal appearance. A deep run requires everything clicking.

---

### 🇰🇷 South Korea — **1.5% win probability** (DK: +6500)

A potential bounce-back candidate with a star-making opportunity.

**Why 1.5%:** Do Yeong Kim (KBO MVP: 30 HR, 40 SB in 2025) is the most-watched player in the tournament for scouts. The WBC is his MLB free agency audition in front of every front office in the sport. Jung Hoo Lee (SF) anchors the MLB contingent. The 2023 version posted a 7.55 ERA as a staff — a disaster they've rebuilt from. Pool C in Tokyo sets up a Japan rematch that could define whether Korean baseball has reclaimed its footing.

**What to watch:** Whether the rebuilt pitching staff can hold leads. Korea's lineup is fine. Their 2023 collapse was entirely pitching-driven.

---

### 🇮🇹 Italy — **1% win probability** (DK: +8000)

Aaron Nola is here, and he's the best pitcher to ever represent Italy.

**Why 1%:** Italy reached the quarterfinals in 2023 — the first time in six WBC editions. Aaron Nola (PHI) fronts the rotation. Through heritage eligibility, Italy has 25 MLB-affiliated players — more than Japan. Jac Caglianone and Vinnie Pasquantino (both KC) anchor the lineup. The pool draw is brutal though: USA and Mexico are both ahead of them in Pool B.

---

### 🇳🇱 Netherlands — **0.8% win probability** (DK: +8000)

The most talent-dense of the +8000 group.

**Why 0.8%:** Xander Bogaerts (SD), Ozzie Albies (ATL), Jurickson Profar (ATL), and Chadwick Tromp (ATL) are legitimate MLB regulars. This roster could realistically win a pool play game against anyone. But Pool D with DR and Venezuela means facing the tournament's deepest bracket.

---

### 🇨🇺 Cuba — **0.7% win probability** (DK: +8000)

Political complications added to roster challenges.

**Why 0.7%:** Cuba's team is in a genuinely difficult situation — 8 support staff members had US visa applications denied (tied to immigration policy changes), though all players and coaches were cleared to enter the country. On the field, Alexei Ramirez will be 44 years old — the oldest player in WBC history. The team's talent level has declined with successive waves of player defections, but in Pool A against Canada and Puerto Rico (both depleted), a quarterfinal appearance isn't impossible.

---

### The Rest — Combined ~3% win probability

- **Colombia (+8000):** Jose Quintana leads the pitching staff. Pool A provides a theoretical path but they face Puerto Rico's home crowd.
- **Panama (+10000):** Edmundo Sosa, Iván Herrera, Leo Jiménez provide MLB depth. Long shots in Pool A.
- **Chinese Taipei (+10000):** Historically competitive in Pool C, but Japan and South Korea are the clear frontrunners.
- **Israel (+20000):** 24 MLB-affiliated players via heritage eligibility (Dean Kremer, Spencer Horwitz, RJ Schreck). More MLB talent than you'd think, but Pool D is too deep.
- **Australia (+20000):** Pool C has Japan. That's the whole story.
- **Great Britain (+20000):** Pool B has Team USA. Same story.
- **Czechia (+20000):** Pool C. Competitive in European baseball, outmatched here.
- **Nicaragua (+40000):** Pool D's true wildcard. No realistic path.
- **Brazil (+40000):** Pool B. The tournament's most mathematically excluded team.

## The Three Storylines That Actually Matter

### 1. Pool D Is Effectively a Knockout Round

Dominican Republic and Venezuela are both legitimate championship contenders. They meet in Pool D, meaning one of them exits before the quarterfinals. This is the single biggest structural distortion in the 2026 WBC. The winner arrives in Miami with battle experience; the loser goes home with legitimate gripes about bracket luck.

**Our lean:** DR (-160 vs Venezuela in pool play per early lines) advances from Pool D. Venezuela — the 2023 team that went 4-0 and still lost to a Turner grand slam — becomes the most devastating early exit in WBC history.

### 2. Can Japan Win Without Their 2023 Pitching Staff?

Roki Sasaki, Yu Darvish, Shota Imanaga: all absent. Three of the five rotation starters who won the championship in 2023 aren't here. Yamamoto as the clear ace is enough to beat most teams. But to beat the USA — which has Skenes and Skubal — the depth behind Yamamoto needs to hold.

**Our lean:** Japan reaches the final. Whether they win it depends on which version of their bullpen shows up.

### 3. Skubal's One Start Changes the USA's Tournament Math

Tarik Skubal — arguably the best pitcher in baseball right now — is being held to a single start due to load management. In a tournament with 4-5 games in two weeks, that's a significant concession. It effectively makes Paul Skenes a one-man pitching advantage for Team USA in the knockout rounds.

---

## Japan vs. USA: If It Happens

The 2023 final — Ohtani striking out Mike Trout to end it — is still the greatest moment in WBC history. A rematch is the storyline everyone wants. Here's how they compare:

- **Starting pitching:** USA advantage (Skenes one game; Yamamoto one game — a wash. USA wins the depth battle.)
- **Lineup power:** USA advantage (Judge, Harper, Raleigh vs Ohtani, Murakami — both elite, but USA has more of it.)
- **Contact/manufacturing runs:** Japan advantage (Suzuki, Yoshida, tournament experience)
- **Bullpen:** Push (Miller/Holmes vs NPB deep pool — too close to call)
- **Cohesion:** Japan advantage (15 returning 2023 champions)

**Seven-game series:** USA wins. **Single elimination:** Flip a coin with a slight Japan lean.

## What Moneyball Dojo Will Track

During the WBC, we'll publish:

- **Daily picks** using our models adapted for international tournament play
- **Player tracking** — WBC performance as a predictor for early-season MLB value
- **Line movement analysis** — which teams the market is mispricing as the tournament unfolds

The WBC is also a data goldmine for our regular season models. Players who excel in high-leverage international competition carry real momentum into April. We track which WBC performers beat their early MLB projections.

## The Bottom Line

**USA at 39%** is fair for the deepest roster ever assembled. Book it.

**Japan at 21%** is undervalued at +330. Defending champions with Ohtani, Yamamoto, and fifteen players who know how to win this tournament. The market is giving USA too much credit for raw talent that hasn't been tested under tournament pressure.

**Dominican Republic at 16%** is the biggest upgrade story of 2026. Cristopher Sánchez's 2025 season transformed their entire tournament profile. This isn't the pitching-weak DR of 2023 anymore.

**Venezuela at 9% (+900)** is the best value on the board — if you can stomach the Pool D gauntlet.

**Mexico at 3% (+2500)** is the sleeper. Muñoz closing is worth two wins by itself. If they escape Pool B, the bracket could gift them a path to the semifinal.
